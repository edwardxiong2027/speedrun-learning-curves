- [ ] Follow exact formatting guidelines

### 3. Prepare Figures
- [ ] Convert figures to required format (usually TIFF or high-res PNG)
- [ ] Add proper figure captions
- [ ] Ensure figures meet JEI size/resolution requirements

### 4. Review Checklist
- [ ] Summary section is under 250 words
- [ ] All citations are properly formatted
- [ ] No unauthorized sections
- [ ] Hypothesis is clearly stated

## Key Research Highlights (for mentor review)

### Why This Research Matters
- First empirical analysis of speedrunning learning curves
- Bridges Wright's 1936 manufacturing theory to modern gaming
- Demonstrates predictable mathematical patterns in collective human optimization
- Strong statistical results (R² = 0.935)

### Novel Contributions
1. Wright's Learning Curve applies to speedrunning (46.7% of categories)
2. Calculated theoretical performance limits for popular games
3. Interactive web tool for exploring the data
4. Open-source code for reproducibility

### Statistical Validity
- 429 world records analyzed
- 15 game categories
- 5 mathematical models compared
- All categories show R² > 0.7
